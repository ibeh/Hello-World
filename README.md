# Hello-World
My First Program on GitHub


I just started immersing myself into programming a few days ago, and I am loving the feeling. I go to bed very late since I started, I dream about codes, and my computer is the first thing I want to jump on after waking up from my short sleep. What a feeling! and I hope this feeling lingers on and open my mind to learning more.
